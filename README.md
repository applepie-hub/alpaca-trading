# Python-Trading-Bot

This Python script implements a crypto trading bot that backtests a Relative Strength Index (RSI) scalping strategy. It focuses on short-term trades within the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute timeframes, aiming for high win-to-loss ratios in spot markets.

- Scalping: A trading strategy that aims to profit from small price movements within a short timeframe.
- RSI: A momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the market.
- Spot Markets: Markets where cryptocurrencies are bought and sold at their current market price.
- Backtesting: Simulating the trading strategy on historical data to assess its performance and identify potential weaknesses before deploying it in live markets.

The project aims to achieve a high win-to-loss ratio (W/R) by identifying profitable trading opportunities within the specified timeframes using the RSI indicator.
